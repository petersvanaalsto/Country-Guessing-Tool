# Country-Guessing-Tool

Description:
Country Guessing is a country guessing quiz game where the user picks a country set to practice and enters as many countries in that region as they can. Each country entered by the user in the entry field is checked to ensure it is a valid country in the chosen region. When all countries are guessed, a win message is printed. If a player gets stuck, they can print out the remaining unguessed countries to study. The game modes include separate country sets for North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and all countries. A study tool was added to aid in learning the respective capitals of countries. The program is displayed using a tkinter developed user interface.

How to run:
To run the program, all files need to be downloaded. The main.py function should be run to start the game. Make sure all files are in the correct directory.
